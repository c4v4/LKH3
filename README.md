# LKH-3.c4v4 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/400224160.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/400224160)


Customized version of Keld Helsgaun's LKH-3 algorithm for vehicle routing problems.  

The code is distributed for academic and non-commercial use. __*All rights reserved to the original author.*__  

The original code is available [here](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3), along with a large dataset of instances for VRP problems supported by the LKH-3 algorithm.  

The aim of this project is to propose some (hopefully useful) performance improvements for the LKH-3 in terms of computing efficiency, maintaining, when possible, the search trajectory with respect to the original code.   

*Part of the development has been carried out during the work for the Set-Partitioning based Local-Search heuristic presented in:*

## Differences with the Original LKH-3

The changes introduced in this version regarded the *Penalty* function of some of the VRP variants (namely, the CVRP and CVRPTW) and the *Flip* function for asymmetric problems. 

__To run the original version, comment out the first 4 lines in the *SRC/Makefile*:__

	#CUSTOM=-DCAVA_CUSTOM
	#CUSTOM_PENALTY=-DCAVA_PENALTY
	#CUSTOM_CACHE=-DCAVA_CACHE 
	#CUSTOM_FLIP=-DCAVA_FLIP 

To activate all the implemented changes, uncomment the first line (default):
	
	CUSTOM=-DCAVA_CUSTOM

To activate only the CVRP and CVRPTW Penalty function optimization, uncomment the second line:

	CUSTOM_PENALTY=-DCAVA_PENALTY

To activate only the new caching system, uncomment the third line:

	CUSTOM_CACHE=-DCAVA_CACHE 
	
To activate only the new Flip function uncomment the fourth line and change the tree representation from TWO_LEVEL_TREE to ONE_LEVEL_TREE:

	CUSTOM_FLIP=-DCAVA_FLIP 
	TREE_TYPE = ONE_LEVEL_TREE

### CVRP and CVRPTW Penalty functions  ([commit](https://github.com/c4v4/LKH3/commit/04c636f6544a4aa6ba9ffd54797e61a5e5651503))

The original penalty function, although optimized with many early-exit conditions, displays a *O(n)* time complexity (where *n* is the number of nodes in the solution). The main idea applied, has been to restrict the exploration of the TSP-tour representation to only the routes touched by the current r-opt move. 

In order to compute the correct penalty value, some data needs to be kept updated between calls. However, this *O(n)* update-step is needed only when an improving solution is found, which rarely happens w.r.t. the common "rejecting case", resulting in an overall speedup.

For the *Penalty* function, CVRP and CVRPTW are used as an example, however, the same techniques can be extended also to other problems with multiple routes. 
### Linear Flip ([commit](https://github.com/c4v4/LKH3/commit/532c5631440154afeb27bac66ef75cae4678af3f))

For problems that are represented using the Jonker-Volgenant ATSP->TSP transformation, no actual flip can happen during the local search. Exploiting this limitation of the r-opt moves in asymmetric problems, the doubly-linked-list based Flip function can be made *O(1)*, with, yet again, the addition of a *O(n)* update-step that needs to be called when an actual improvement is found. 

Note that, switching from the two-level tree representation to the single-level one (i.e. the doubly-linked-list representation) affects the search trajectory, resulting in different solutions.

### Caching Systems 

A smaller improvement has also been obtained moving the cost function cache-check inside a small prologue (another smaller function called before the original one), ready to be inlined by the compiler.   

## Benchmarks 

A brief set of benchmarks have been executed to test the speedup with CVRP and CVRPTW instances. The result of the test, for each version of the algorithm, are given as csv files inside the folder BENCHMARKS, within the CVRP and CVRPTW directories. 

The results are also available as a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Esg-xHBSdPgNsuO5iTLkXmuDSP0oPHyUJFNkHZDvqa0/edit?usp=sharing). 

For all the tests, only the time of the single *RUN* has been counted, ignoring the setup time needed by the ascent procedure to define the candidate set. 
Moreover, in the plots that follow, the x axis displays the *Customers + Vehicles* sum, since inside the LKH-3 each solution is represented with a TSP-tour of such size (or twice as big for asymmetric problems).
### CVRP Speedup
For the CVRP variant the full Uchoa dataset (containing 100 instances, from 100 to 1000 customers) along with the Belgium dataset (containing 10 instances, from 3000 to 30000 customers) have been used.  

Both the original LKH-3 and the customized one have been tested with 4 different random seeds, executing a single *RUN* per seed. For the Uchoa instances, the number of *TRIALS* have been set to 10000, while, for the bigger Belgium instances, 5000 *TRIALS* have been used. 

Speedup for Uchoa instances only:

Speedup for both Uchoa and Belgium instances:

### CVRPTW Speedup
For the CVRPTW problem, a subset of the Homberger dataset has been selected. A total of 60 instances have been chosen, randomly selecting 2 instances for each one the classes. In total, there are 5 sizes (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 customers), and 6 classes for each size.

Also in this case, the tests have been run with 4 different random seeds, with a single *RUN* of 10000 *TRIALS* each. 

Three version have been tested, namely: 

1. **Orig:** The original LKH-3. 
2. **Pen:** The LKH-3 with only the new Penalty and caching system (which maintain the same search trajectory w.r.t. the original). 
3. **All:** The LKH-3 with the new Penalty, caching system and Flip function (which obtain different results due to a different search trajectory). 

The speedup between the original and version 2 (blue), and between the original and version 3 (red) is here reported.

## Original README.txt content:

LKH is an implementation of the Lin-Kernighan traveling salesman heuristic.

the code.

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION: (Version 3.0.6 - May 2019)

The software is available in gzipped tar format:

	LKH-3.0.6.tgz	(approximately 2.3 MB)

Download the software and execute the following UNIX commands:

  	tar xvfz LKH-3.0.6.tgz
   	cd LKH-3.0.5
	make

An executable file called LKH will now be available in the directory LKH-3.0.6.

To test the installation run the program by typing ./LKH pr2392.par. 
Then press return. The program should now solve a TSP instance with 2392 nodes.

For testing the installation on an mTSP problem, type ./LKH whizzkids96.par.
Then press return.

A two-level tree is used as the default tour representation. 
A three-level tree representation may be used instead by compiling the
source code with the compiler option 

	-DTHREE_LEVEL_TREE

Just edit the first line in SRC/Makefile and execute the commands

	make clean
	make

### CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.3:

Candidate sets may now be created by means of POPMUSIC by giving the following
specification in the parameter file for LKH:

	CANDIDATE_SET_TYPE = POPMUSIC

The value of the parameter MAX_CANDIDATES is used to trim the candidate set.
There are, however, some other POPMUSIC related parameters. If not specified,
they will take their default values. These parameters are:

    POPMUSIC_SAMPLE_SIZE = <int>  
    Sample size.
    Default: 10.

    POPMUSIC_SOLUTIONS = <int> 
    Number of solutions to generate.
    Default: 50.

    POPMUSIC_MAX_NEIGHBORS = <int>
    Maximum number of nearest neighbors used as candidates in iterated 3-opt for
    POPMUSIC.
    Default: 5.

    POPMUSIC_TRIALS = <int>
    Number of trials used in iterated 3-opt for POPMUSIC. 
    If the value is zero, the number of trials is the size of the subpath
    to be optimized.
    Default: 1.

    POPMUSIC_INITIAL_TOUR = { YES | NO }
    Specifies whether the first generated POPMUSIC tour is used as
    initial tour for Lin-Kernighan.
    Default: NO.

### CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.2:

Tours may now be recombined by GPX2 (Generalized Partition Crossover 2) 
instead of IPT (Iterative Partial Transcription). 

GPX2 is used by giving the following specification in the parameter file:

	RECOMBINATION = GPX2

The possible settings are:

	RECOMBINATION = { IPT | GPX2 } 

IPT is default.
